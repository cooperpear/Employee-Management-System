# Employee Management System
Employee Management System takes in user inputs via node inquirer package. It stores the users data inputs into an SQL database. It provides a server.js file that will use mySQL to connect to your SQL database. It then generates a list of databases in table form (in your terminal) and the option to add new data. 

## Deployed
This is a command line program so it is not deployed. Download the files, install your node packages, and then run (node server.js) to begin user input prompt. Output view to terminal and SQL database GUI.
